# COVID19-TRACKER

Hi everyone, I wanted to share a website I recently developed to help track and map the #covid19 cases in the U.S. The website can be accessed from here: http://covidtracker.schen.org

On March 27th, the NYT made public their Coronavirus case data, which is tracked to the county level and fills the gap as no single agency has provided the public with an accurate, up-to-date record of coronavirus cases, according to NYT.

Leveraging this data and census information, I attempted to map these cases to each county, and include time lapse effects to visualize how small number of known cases can mushroom into an outbreak quickly (see video). You may access more up-to-date and interactive maps on the website above.
